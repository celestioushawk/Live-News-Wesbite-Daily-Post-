This is a live news website that I have created using the NewsAPI.org API with using PHP as the backend and HTML/CSS as the front-end. I learned a lot of things while working on this project, such as:

-News Api custom search fields

-CSS Flexbox

-Designing the website layout considering a nice user experience

-Traversing JSON Array which is returning multiple items

-Handling the empty array error

-I also learned creating dynamic links in the <a></a> tag and sending data to the other page through it

Hope you like the project. 
Thank You.
